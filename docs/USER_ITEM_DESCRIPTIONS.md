# User Item Descriptions

Design specifications for items to implement. These are the source of truth for item mechanics.

---

## BODY Items

### Brass Knuckles
- +1 attack per turn (can probably use cooldown for this?)
- Improve strength scaling
- Both effects scale with item level

### Baseball Bat
- Add a multiplier to body damage, scales with item level
- Changes attack to "swing bat"

### Wheatie-O's Cereal
- Increase BODY stat by +1 per level

### Trail Mix
- Ziploc bag of assorted trail mix
- Improve hp regen
- Rarest of the bunch

## MIND Items

### Binoculars
- Should increase PERCEPTION dramatically
- Scale moderately with level

### Coach's Whistle
- Double damage if the MIND attack is sound based
- Need to add tags to attacks for this
- Scales as it levels up

### Siren's Lungs
- Transforms BODY attacks to be sound-based (adds "sound" tag)
- Changes attack to AOE_AROUND pattern like whistle
- Synergizes with Coach's Whistle (sound damage multiplier applies!)
- Example combo: Brass Knuckles + Siren's Lungs + Coach's Whistle = multiple sound-based AOE attacks per turn

### Telepathic Punching Item (TBD)
- Something that turns the MIND attack from a whistle to telepathic punching
- Design not finalized

## NULL Items

### Lucky Rabbit's Foot
- For a small mana cost and small cooldown
- Has a small chance to reset another item's cooldown randomly
- Chance improves with level

### Roman Coin
- Improves mana regen

### Antigonous Family Notebook
- RARE item
- Increase corruption by some amount per item level
- Big increase to NULL stat
- With enough mana: negates the next damage source once per cooldown
